# project Name: Water saver
# Description: 
We are currently building an educational website for students aged 10 to 16. The website aims to provide our audience with information regarding the importance of water conservation and water protection. The website has multiple features - tips on water conservation and ways to protect water, mini-game and quiz functions to help our users test their knowledge in a fun manner, a calculator on water usage so that audiences can keep track of their daily water usage and see areas of improvement. Additionally, maps will be provided to enable the audience to view water catchment areas and litter trap positions near them and around Melbourne.
# How to deploy the website
