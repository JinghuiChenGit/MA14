            <p> Marine pollution, 80% of which is generated by land-based activities, is having a devastating effect on
                our oceans. As well as degrading habitat, pollution directly threatens marine animals and plants, some
                of them rare and endangered.

                Oil spills can be catastrophic, but not all the oil that enters the sea leaks from ships. A large amount
                of oil can be traced back to factories within our cities - and poor containment or disposal methods.

                Garbage discarded in our oceans poses a number of dangers. Marine species often mistake plastics, for
                instance, as food, only to experience excruciating deaths when it blocks their breathing passages and
                stomachs. Discarded â€˜ghost nets' and fishing gear can also seem like a tasty morsel or entrap unwitting
                marine animals.

                When detergents, fertilisers or sewage containing a variety of chemicals are discharged into our oceans,
                especially in large doses, it can begin the lethal process known as eutrophication. The excess nutrients
                cause plants and algae to bloom, reducing water quality and depleting the supply of dissolved oxygen. At
                its worst, this suffocates marine life.
